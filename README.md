# Introduction - MMD and MM Bank
This is a project of MSBD5017 Introduction to Blockchain Technology. 

In the MMD (Meta Merchant Dot) Community, MM Bank provides one-stop shop services to both Merchants and Users with its distributed ledger and online teller, “MM Bank” application. This program enables Merchants to carry out operations of the two circulating currencies, MMD and CMMD. They can purchase MMD with Ether, pledge MMD to obtain CMMD and transfer CMMD to other Merchants and Users.

Run the following command to build the app for production in the `build` folder with optimization for the best performance.

`npm run build`

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**


If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

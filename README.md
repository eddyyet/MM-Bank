# MM Bank
The **MM Bank** application provides one-stop shop decentralized financial services to both Merchants and Users with its distributed ledger and online teller.

Features:
- Fully **decentralized** - both the application and ledger balances - for security
- Support the **dual token system** (MMD and CMMD) with two smart contracts that interact with each other
- **Deposit**, **withdrawal**, **borrow** and **transfer** for daily economic activities
- **Collateral requirement** (lock MMD to borrow CMMD) and **liquidation** as credit risk control

(This is a course project for MSBD5017 in HKUST in Fall 2022-23)
